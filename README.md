# 🌐 JLang — A Custom Programming Language for DSA Visualization

**JLang** is a beginner-friendly programming language and custom IDE built from scratch using Java. It’s designed to help students and developers **learn and visualize core Data Structures** through code execution, with **real-time visual feedback**.

JLang compiles to **Java bytecode**, runs on the **JVM**, and comes with a dedicated IDE that supports live visualizations of data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs.

## ✨ Features in v1

✅ Clean and simple syntax:

fn<>greet() {
    println("Welcome to JLang!");
}

fn<int>main() {
    greet();

    Let l = new LinkedList();
    l.insert(10);
    l.insert(20);
    l.visualize();

    return 0;
}





```jlang
Let age = 21;
greet();
fn<>greet() {
    println("Hello, world!");
}

✅ Visual DSA support out of the box:

Linked List

Tree (Binary Tree)

Graph (Undirected)

Array

Stack

Queue

✅ Custom-built IDE with:

Code editor for .jlang files

Syntax highlighting and error reporting

Real-time structure visualization panel

Run and Reset controls

✅ JVM-based compilation:

JLang code is compiled into Java bytecode

Runs via the JVM with native performance and platform portability

✅ Education-focused:

Helps users understand how data structures behave step by step

Built-in methods like .insert(), .delete(), .traverse(), .visualize()

💻 Tech Stack
Java 17

JavaFX (for IDE + visualization)

Custom lexer, parser, and AST builder

JVM bytecode generator (via ASM or Java source+compiler)

Designed for cross-platform use

🚀 How It Works
Write your code in JLang using the built-in IDE

Hit Run

JLang code is compiled into JVM bytecode

JavaFX-based runtime executes the logic and animates DSA operations live

🛠️ Example Program
jlang
Copy
Edit
Let l = new LinkedList();
l.insert(10);
l.insert(20);
l.visualize();
🎯 Goals
Make learning DSA more interactive and fun

Help beginners understand how data structures actually work

Provide a lightweight language with real compiler experience

Build an integrated tool for both practice and teaching

📅 Roadmap
 Language syntax design
