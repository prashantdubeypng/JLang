## 💡 About JLang

**JLang** is a minimalist programming language designed for learning DSA concepts. It's inspired by Java but removes boilerplate and focuses on clarity and visualization.

### ✅ Syntax Overview

```jlang
// Declare variables
Let name = "Prashant";
Let age = 36;
Let isCompiled = true;
Let CGPA = 8.54;

// Define functions
fn<>sayHello() {
    println("Hello from JLang!");
}

fn<int>main() {
    sayHello();

    Let l = new LinkedList();
    l.insert(10);
    l.insert(20);
    l.visualize();

    return 0;
}
