# 🧠 JLang IDE — A Visual IDE for DSA in Java & JLang

Welcome to **JLang IDE**, a developer-friendly programming environment that makes it easier to **learn, visualize, and write** data structure algorithms — either in **Java** or in a custom-built educational language called **JLang**.

JLang IDE is focused on helping students and developers **see how their code behaves** using live, animated visualizations of Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Queues, Stacks, and more.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ **Dual Language Support**: Write and run code in Java or JLang
- 📚 **Built-in DSA Visualizations**: Linked List, Tree, Graph, Stack, Queue, Array
- 👁️ **Real-Time Execution Canvas**: See your data structures change in real time
- 🎯 **Lightweight IDE Interface**: Intuitive UI built for focused problem-solving
- 🧵 **Bundled JVM Runtime**: No external setup required
- 🧪 **Educational Syntax (JLang)**: Simple and expressive syntax ideal for learning DSA

## 💡 About JLang

**JLang** is a minimalist programming language designed for learning DSA concepts. It's inspired by Java but removes boilerplate and focuses on clarity and visualization.

### ✅ Syntax Overview

```jlang
// Declare variables
Let name = "Prashant";
Let age = 36;
Let isCompiled = true;
Let CGPA = 8.54;

// Define functions
fn<>sayHello() {
    println("Hello from JLang!");
}

fn<int>main() {
    sayHello();

    Let l = new LinkedList();
    l.insert(10);
    l.insert(20);
    l.visualize();

    return 0;
}

🔧 Tech Stack
Language: Java (for IDE and backend)

Runtime: JVM (for both JLang + Java support)

Compiler: Custom compiler for JLang → JVM Bytecode

UI: JavaFX or Swing (depending on setup)

Packaging: Launch4j / jpackage (.exe bundling)

📦 Installation
Download the latest .exe release from Releases

Run the installer or unzip the folder

Double-click JLang.exe to launch

Start coding in .jlang or .java mode

Java is not required to be installed — the IDE bundles its own JVM.

🔮 Future Plans
Class/object support in JLang

Custom JLang standard library

Dark/light theme toggle

Step-by-step execution

Linux & macOS builds
